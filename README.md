# OW2-Stadium-Build-Auto-Optimizer
Tell it what kind of build you want, it'll give you the mathematically optimal build.

This current version is just a proof of concept. I started cramming all the functionality I wanted into the single UI I built for simple data entry. 
I busted out this entire app with cursor in like a couple hours. It works surprisingly well considering its about 75% AI.
I'm going to have to rewrite the majority of my code so it's not a confusing AI mess, but once I'm done we'll have a very polished application.
It's still missing a LOT of features. But imma make a youtube video showing how to use it and once you watch that you'll get the idea.

## Planned Features
- Add key to track which heroes are able to use each item.
- Noisy weights
  - Add noise by adjusting every single weight by -10% to +20%.
- Extra weight on items the user hasn't tried
- ~~Speed up knapsack algorithm~~
- ~~Major refactor to clean out AI garbage~~
