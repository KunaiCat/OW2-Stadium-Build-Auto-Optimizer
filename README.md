# OW2-Stadium-Build-Auto-Optimizer
Tell it what kind of build you want, it'll give you the mathematically optimal build.

This current version is just a proof of concept. I started cramming all the functionality I wanted into the single UI I built for simple data entry. 
I busted out this entire app with cursor in like a couple hours. It works surprisingly well considering its about 75% AI.
I'm going to have to rewrite the majority of my code so it's not a confusing AI mess, but once I'm done we'll have a very polished application.
It's still missing a LOT of features. But imma make a youtube video showing how to use it and once you watch that you'll get the idea.

## Planned Features
- Build a UI that makes sense, not everything crammed on 1 page
- Set effect weight by multiplying a base weight by the weights of whatever optional fields that effect gives.
- Hide ALL weights
  - Just enable the ability to give a + or - to every weight involved after a budget calculation.
  - Make sure those + and - buttons are EVERYWHERE
  - Track the button presses over time to adjust the increment to do Newtonian approximation
  - Don't show the user the increment or real weight
  - Easy ways to upvote/downvote an item if you liked it or not.
- Add key to track which heroes are able to use each item.
- Noisy weights
  - Add noise by adjusting every single weight by -10% to +20%.
- Extra weight on items the user hasn't tried
- Speed up knacksack algorithm
